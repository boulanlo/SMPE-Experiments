#+Title: Graph experiment
#+Author: Louis Boulanger

* Original graph
I found this graph on the website of the Mairie de la Clusaz:

[[./original.jpg]]

Some criticisms for this graph:
- The y axis starts at 800
- The years are not spaced according to the time between each date,
  leading to an evolution that isn't representative of the truth

* New graph
I made the new graph in R, using the [[./data.txt][data]] taken directly from the
graph. I removed from the data the date far into the past, as it is
not relevant for the graph.

  geom_text(aes(label=pop), vjust=-1) +

  ggtitle("Evolution of the population of La Clusaz (74)") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Population") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
