* Original graph
I found this graph on the website of the Mairie de la Clusaz:

Some criticisms for this graph:
- The y axis starts at 800
- The years are not spaced according to the time between each date,
  leading to an evolution that isn't representative of the truth

* New graph
I made the new graph in R using [[./clusaz.org][this file]], containing the instructions
to reproduce the graph; as well as the [[./data.txt][data]], taken directly from the
graph. I removed from the data the date far into the past, as it is
not relevant for the graph.
